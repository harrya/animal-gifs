# animal-gifs

## Brief

Our product owners have tasked us with building an app that helps our patients' kids have something to entertain themselves with while they wait for their appointments.

Given a list of animals, build an app that pulls a random set of gifs for the chosen one using https://giphy.com. We have decided to start with cats, dogs, elephants, lions, and monkeys, because who doesn't love monkeys?!
